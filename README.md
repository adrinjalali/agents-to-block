# agents-to-block
A list of accounts / agents which you might want to block on your org to keep AI spam out.


Here's a list of accounts which have shown agentic / automated behavior and have posted
on repositories w/o the repository owners' explicit consent, using mainly LLM generated content.
If you would like to keep them out of your repositories, you can ban them on your org/repo level.

Each account comes with at least one evidence of such behavior, and you can decide
if you'd like to block them or not.
